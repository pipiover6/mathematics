Definition. A (mathematical) juggling pattern is a permutation $f:\Z\to\Z$ for which $\d f(t)=f(t)-t\ge 0$.\\


We think of $t\in \Z$ as a discrete, infinite in both directions time parameter. If there is no "throw" at time $t$, we set $f(t)=t$, and otherwise we set $f(t)$ to be the next time the "ball" thrown at $t$ will be thrown again. We think of $\d f(t)$ as the "height" of the throw. This model assumes only one ball may be thrown at once.\\


Observation. Each orbit is either a fixed point (no throw) or infinite in both directions.\\


The "balls" are in one to one correspondence with the infinite orbits.\\


Observation. If $\d f$ is bounded by $M$ then so is the number of balls.\\


What does $\sum_{t\in I}\d f(t)$ count for an interval $I$? well, it counts the "skips" of one ball over another. Approximately, if $I$ is very large, this equals $\abs{I}$ times the number of balls, since each time frame is "skipped over" once by each ball. Another way to see this is the following. The sum of $\d f$ over a ball's orbit in an interval is the last after minus first appearence in that interval, which is $|I| \pm O(M)$.

\section*{random abstract algebra bits}


Exercise. Given an operator $T\in\Lin(V)$ if $v_0,Tv_0,\dots,T^{d-1}v_0$ is a basis of $V$ for some $v_0$, then $ST=TS\iff S$ is a polynomial in $T$.\\


Observation. The following are equivalent for a finite group $G$.
\begin{itemize}
\item The composition $G\xrightarrow{\cay}\perm(G)\xrightarrow{\sgn}\{\pm1\}$ is non-trivial.
\item $2\mid \ord(G)$ and $G$ has an element of order $2^{\nu_2(\ord(G))}$.
\item $2\mid \ord(G)$ and $G$'s \syl{2} subgroups are cyclic.
\\
\end{itemize} 
Corollary. Let $G$ be a finite group. Then the set elements of odd order $O$ forms a subgroup, under the assumption that $G$ has an element of order $2^{\nu_2(\ord(G))}$. Moreover, $[G:O]=2^{\nu_2(\ord(G))}$.
\\\\
Proof. Write $\ord(G)=2^k(2\ell-1)$. The case $k=0$ is trivial. If $k\ge1$, then the composition $G\to\perm(G)\to\set{\pm1}$ is non-trivial. Thus $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ of index $2$. We have $\ord(N)=2^{k-1}(2\ell-1)$, $O_G=O_N$, and $N$ has an element of order $2^{k-1}$. q.e.d.
\\\\
Observation. Let $M$ be a semi-group of $n$ elements. Then $m^{\lcm(1,\dots,n)}=m^{2\lcm(1,\dots,n)}$ for all $m\in M$.
\\\\
Corollary. Let $A\in\Z^{n\times n}$ be a $k$-th power of an integral matrix for all $k\ge 2$. Then $A=A^2=A^3=\dots$
\\\\
Proof. It suffices to show $A=A^2$ when reduced mod $p$ for each prime $p$. However, working in $M=\F_p^{n\times n}$ we have $\bar{A}={X}^{\lcm(1,\dots,p^{n^2})}$ which implies $\bar{A}=\bar{A}^2$.
\\\\



A bashing proof of theorema egregium. Let $X=X(u,v):D\sub\R^2\overset{\sim}{\to}S\subn \R^3$ be a surface parametrization. Let $$N=\dfrac{X_u\times X_v}{\norm{X_u\times X_v}}$$ be the normal, and
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}
E & F\\
F & G
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
X_{u}\cdot X_{u} & X_{u}\cdot X_{v}\\
X_{u}\cdot X_{v} & X_{v}\cdot X_{v}
\end{array}\right)$$ be the first fundamental form, namely the surface isometry invariant. To compute the partials of the first fundamental form entries we write
$$\begin{array}{ccc}
X_{uu} =\alpha X_{u} + \beta X_{v} + eN\\\\
X_{uv} = \eps X_{u} + \zeta X_{v} + fN\\\\
X_{vv} = \gamma X_{u} + \delta X_{v} + gN
\end{array}$$\\
Then we have
%$$
%\begin{array}{ccccc}
%X_{uu} & = & \alpha X_{u} + & \beta X_{v} + & eN\\
%X_{vv} & = & \gamma X_{u} + & \delta X_{v} + & gN\\
%X_{uv} & = & \eps X_{u} + & \zeta X_{v} + & fN
%\end{array}
%$$
%\\
$$
\begin{array}{c}
E_{u} = 2(\alpha E+\beta F)\\\\
E_{v} = 2(\eps E+\zeta F)\\\\
G_{u} = 2(\eps F+\zeta G)\\\\
G_{v}  =  2(\gamma F+\delta G)\\\\
F_u=\alpha F + \beta G + \eps E  + \zeta F\\\\
F_v = \gamma E + \delta F + \eps F + \zeta G\\
\end{array}
$$\\
Which mean
$$\begin{array}{c}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
E & F\\
F & G
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\eps\\
\zeta
\end{array}\right)=\hlf\left(\begin{array}{c}
E_{v}\\
G_{u}
\end{array}\right)\\\\
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
E & F\\
F & G
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\alpha\\
\beta
\end{array}\right)=\hlf\left(\begin{array}{c}
E_{u}\\
2F_{u}-E_{v}
\end{array}\right)\\\\
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
E & F\\
F & G
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\gamma\\
\delta
\end{array}\right)=\hlf\left(\begin{array}{c}
2F_{v}-G_{u}\\
G_{v}
\end{array}\right)
\end{array}$$\\
And so the first fundamental form determines $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,\eps,\zeta$. Gauss's theorem, which we shall now prove, is that $eg-f^2$ is also determined by the first fundamental form. Firstly, since $N\perp X_u$ and $N\perp X_v$ we have 
$$\begin{array}{c}
e=X_{uu}\cdot N=-N_{u}\cdot X_{u}\\
f=X_{uv}\cdot N=-N_{v}\cdot X_{u}=-N_{u}\cdot X_{v}\\
g=X_{vv}\cdot N=-N_{v}\cdot X_{v}
\end{array}$$
Moreover, since $\norm{N}\equiv 1$ we may write 
$$\begin{array}{c}
N_{u}=a^{11}X_{u}+a^{12}X_{v}\\
N_{v}=a^{21}X_{u}+a^{22}X_{v}
\end{array}$$\\
which yields
$$\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a^{11} & a^{12}\\
a^{21} & a^{22}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
E & F\\
F & G
\end{array}\right)=-\left(\begin{array}{cc}
e & f\\
f & g
\end{array}\right)$$\\
We write $K=a^{11}a^{22}-a^{12}a^{21}=\dfrac{eg-f^2}{EG-F^2}$ for the Gaussian curvature. Now, we have
$$\begin{array}{c}
X_{uuv}=\alpha_{v}X_{u}+\alpha X_{uv}+\beta_{v}X_{v}+\beta X_{vv}+e_{v}N+eN_{v}\\
X_{uvu}=\eps_{u}X_{u}+\eps X_{uu}+\zeta_{u}X_{v}+\zeta X_{uv}+f_{u}N+fN_{u}
\end{array}$$
Comparing the $X_v$ part we get 
$$\alpha\zeta+\beta_{v}+\beta\delta+ea^{22}=\eps\beta+\zeta_{u}+\zeta^{2}+fa^{12}$$
Now, by the matrix equation we have that
$$\eps\beta+\zeta_{u}+\zeta^{2}-\alpha\zeta-\beta_{v}-\beta\delta=ea^{22}-fa^{12}=-EK$$
is determined by the first fundamental form. Since $E$ is positive, $K$ is determined by the first fundamental form.\\
Gauss's theorem, for example, implies that no part of a sphere can be isometrically embedded in the plane. Any map of the globe, no matter of how small a region, will have distorsions.
\\\\
In orthogonal coordinates $E=A^2,F=0,G=B^2$ we get $$K=-\dfrac{1}{AB}\left(\partial_{v}\left(\dfrac{A_{v}}{B}\right)+\partial_{u}\left(\dfrac{B_{u}}{A}\right)\right)$$
In particular, 
in isothermal coordinates $E=G=\lambda$, $F=0$ we have $$K=-\dfrac{\lap \log \lambda}{2\lambda}$$.
\\\\
To me, this finally gives a definition of the curvature of the hyperbolic plane and shows it is $-1$. Indeed, the hyperbolic plane is nothing but $H=\{y>0\}$ with the metric given by $\dfrac{\sqrt{\d x^2+\d y^2}}{y}$. Namely, the first fundamental form is $y^{-2}\id$. This immediately yields $K=-1$.
\\\\
Theorem. $\nu_p(n!)=\floor{n/p}+\floor{n/p^2}+\floor{n/p^3}+\dots$
\\\\
Theorem. $(p-1)\nu_p(n!)=n-s_p(n)$ where $s_p(n)$ is the digit sum of $n$ in base $p$.
\\\\
Theorem. $\nu_p{p^k\choose r}=k-\nu_p(r)$
\\\\
Given $v_1,\dots,v_{n-1}\in\R^n$ linearly independent, how can one find a vector $w$ spanning $(v_1,\dots,v_{n-1})^{\perp}$?\\
Assuming these are row vectors, put them in an $n\times n$ determinant, where the first row is $x_1,\dots,x_n$. \\
This gives a nontrivial linear form in $x$, which vanishes for $x\in\{v_1,\dots,v_{n-1}\}$. It is of course of the form $x\mapsto x\cdot w$ for the $w$ we are looking for. To get $w$ explicitly, note that it's $i$-th coordinate is $e_i\cdot w=\det(e_i,v_1,\dots,v_{n-1})$. Moreover, the length of $w$ is precisely the $n-1$ dimensional volume of the parallelepide spanned by $v_1,\dots,v_{n-1}$. Indeed, $w\cdot w=\det(w,v_1,\dots,v_{n-1})=\vol_{n-1}(v_i)\cdot \norm{w}$, since $w$ is perpendicular to the $v_i$.

\section*{problems}

A two player game with $n$ lamps in a circle is played as follows. In the beginning, player 1 chooses which lamps should be on and which should be off. After that, in each turn, player 2 specifies which lamps should be switched (on$\leftrightarrow$off), but player 1 may rotate the cicle of lamps as they please before making the switches. Player 2 wins once all lamps are off. Find for which $n$ player 2 can win, and how.
\\\\%for powers of 2, R = rotation, then I+R is nilpotent, and so after n turns of specifying the current board player 2 will win

A two player game with a standard deck of cards is played as follows. In the beginning, player 1 randomly shuffles the deck. Then, at any point, player 2 can either bet that the next card will be red, or choose to see the next card. The game ends once the bet is made, and player 2 wins if they guessed right. (Player 2 must make a bet at some point, so if 51 cards were seen the last card has to be betted on). Show that no matter what strategy player 2 picks, they will win an expected $1/2$ of the games they play.
