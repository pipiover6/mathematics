### The job of a mathematician, and that of the author

A mathematician is an explorer, playfully discovering how things work, applying their own methods and forming their own understanding of the mathematical world.
And so, I shall try to motivate the reader to do the actual work - discovery, and understanding.

### The nature of exploration

Exploring naively and even for a long time is the job of a mathematician - it's what develops intuition and deep understanding.
Exploring with advanced tools is not as much fun, nor is it natural to start with. Moreover, it is the explorer's job to first discover these tools.
Moreover, it is always more enlightning to read how the greats started a branch of mathematics than it is to read the hindsight of the modern version which makes so many difficult steps appear natural.

### Order of presentation

Mathematics, like life, is about the jouney and not the destination.
If our journey leads us to discover what we believe is a theorem, we should look for a proof. Once we found one, we present the theorem before the proof.
However, our journey could also lead us to an general argument, not a result. In this case, the argument should be presented before its final conclusion.
